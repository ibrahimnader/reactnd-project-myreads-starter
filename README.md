# MyReads Project

This is a Reactjs project for categorizing books in shelfs 
the app have two pages: The main page which shows 3 shelves for books and search page and ss the user types into the search field, books that match the query are displayed on the page and the user can add books from the search page to the shelves


## Installation

To get started 

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
